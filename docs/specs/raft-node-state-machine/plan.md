# Raft Node State Machine — Design Narrative

## Design provenance

This spec was iterated against an automated evaluator across multiple rounds.
Resolved per-iteration decisions are folded into the body (see `## Resolved
Decisions` and `## Cross-Document Supersedes`); historical per-iteration
checklists live in the commit messages and the workstream's `## Iteration
Summary` tab rather than in this long-lived document.

### Prior feedback resolution (iteration 5)

The iteration-4 evaluator (score 86) raised three concrete gaps. Each is
addressed in this iteration:

1. `ADDRESSED` — **YAML folded scalar splits identifiers.** The
   `step-single-voter-self-quorum-cascade` entry in `wit-tree.yaml` no
   longer embeds the four identifiers
   (`single-voter-cluster-auto-promotes-to-leader`,
   `single_voter_cluster_auto_promotes_to_leader`,
   `election-loop-in-single-voter-cluster-via-tick`,
   `election_loop_in_single_voter_cluster_via_tick`) inside a folded
   `description:` block where YAML's `>-` folding could insert spaces
   into the identifier. Every identifier now lives as an atomic,
   double-quoted YAML scalar under a new structured
   `test_obligations:` field (verified by `yaml.safe_load` round-trip
   in this commit). The folded `description:` only contains prose.
2. `ADDRESSED` — **Backtick-wrapped identifier split across lines in
   `plan.md` Resolved Decisions.** Item 2 of `## Resolved Decisions`
   was rewritten so each backtick-quoted identifier sits on a single
   physical source line; the same atomic-identifier discipline is
   used in the rewritten Step 2.5 narrative.
3. `ADDRESSED` — **Weakened action-order / zero-`SendMessage`
   obligation on the direct `become_candidate()` scenario.** Step 2.5
   in this plan and the `test_obligations` block in `wit-tree.yaml`
   now explicitly separate (a) **existing source assertions** — what
   `xraft-core/src/node.rs::single_voter_cluster_auto_promotes_to_leader`
   already verifies (role, membership of `PersistHardState`,
   `BecomeLeader`, `AppendEntries(no-op)`) — from (b) **spec
   hardening assertions Stage 3.1 MUST add** when the test is updated
   (`current_term() == Term(1)`, zero `SendMessage`, and the strict
   `PersistHardState`-emitted-first action ordering). This restores
   the strong contract the iter-2 plan had while staying honest about
   what the current source test does and does not yet prove.

A fourth iter-4 finding — that "nearby dependencies still reference
`phase-raft-consensus-engine`" in `implementation-plan.md` — was
re-verified against the current file and is `NOT FOUND` for
dependency anchors. Every `Dependencies:` line in
`docs/stories/failover-cluster-XRAFT/implementation-plan.md` now uses
the canonical `phase-consensus-engine` anchor: the anchored grep
`grep -n "^- phase-raft-consensus-engine"
docs/stories/failover-cluster-XRAFT/implementation-plan.md` returns
zero matches, while `grep -n "^- phase-consensus-engine"
docs/stories/failover-cluster-XRAFT/implementation-plan.md` returns
four matches — Stage 3.2's dep on
`phase-consensus-engine/stage-raft-node-state-machine`, Stage 3.3's
dep on `phase-consensus-engine/stage-leader-election`, Phase 4's
parent dep on `phase-consensus-engine`, and Phase 5's parent dep on
`phase-consensus-engine`. The unanchored grep
`grep "phase-raft-consensus-engine"
docs/stories/failover-cluster-XRAFT/implementation-plan.md` matches
*only* the new Stage 3.1 "Canonical anchor disambiguation" callout
that quotes the full git branch name
(`ws/failover-cluster-XRAFT/phase-raft-consensus-engine-stage-raft-node-state-machine`)
to explain why the workstream branch is named differently from the
canonical anchor — i.e. the only remaining matches are *prose that
explicitly warns about the slug difference*, not dependency anchors.
The same two surviving occurrences of `phase-raft-consensus-engine`
in `docs/stories/failover-cluster-XRAFT/workstreams.yaml` are the
factual git `branch:` value and its explanatory comment; these are
not dependency anchors and would break the workstream tooling if
renamed.

### Iter-7 note: scope reaffirmation

Iteration 6 attempted to also commit source-side hardening assertions
to `xraft-core/src/node.rs::single_voter_cluster_auto_promotes_to_leader`
(the three Step 2.5 checks: `current_term() == Term(1)`, zero
`Action::SendMessage`, and the strict `PersistHardState`-first
ordering). That source-side edit was prepared in the working tree
but never committed because **the planning brief explicitly forbids
modifying source files outside `docs/specs/`** ("Do NOT write
application code, tests, or modify source files outside
`docs/specs/`"). Iteration 7 reverts the unstaged source-tree
modification and keeps the iter-5 design narrative as the canonical
contract; the three Step 2.5 hardening assertions remain
**implementation-PR obligations** owned by the engineer who lands
the `step-single-voter-self-quorum-cascade` step, not by this
planning document. The attribution is tightened in Step 2.5 below
and in `wit-tree.yaml` under the new
`implementation_pr_owner` field on every entry of
`step-single-voter-self-quorum-cascade.test_obligations`.

## Context and Intent

XRAFT is a Rust implementation of the Raft consensus protocol that follows
the KRaft (Apache Kafka's Raft) variant: pull-based log replication, a
single voter set per cluster, gRPC transport, and a strict I/O-free core
engine. References that shaped the design:

- KRaft deep dive (Red Hat Developers, Sep 2025) — pull-based fetch model
  and `quorum-state` persistence.
- Confluent KRaft learn module — leader-epoch fencing, observer joins.
- `dragotin/kraft` (Rust KRaft prototype) — naming and crate split.

The work item **"Raft Node State Machine"** scopes the *engine*: the pure
state object every node carries, the input dispatcher, and the role-
transition methods. It is a *new* stage inserted before
`stage-leader-election` (Stage 3.2 in `implementation-plan.md`) and
`stage-log-replication` (Stage 3.3), both of which depend on the
structures and the `step()` dispatcher delivered here.

Crate placement is `xraft-core/src/node.rs` (engine), reusing the
existing `xraft-core/src/{message,types,config,error}.rs` modules from
the Project-Scaffolding phase. The work item must NOT touch
`xraft-storage`, `xraft-transport`, or `xraft-server` — wiring is owned
by later phases (Persistent Storage, Networking, Integration).

## Architectural Approach

### Pure step-function engine

Following the Heidi Howard / TigerBeetle pattern and matching KRaft's
`KafkaRaftClient`, the engine is a single object accessed only through:

```rust
pub fn step(&mut self, input: Input) -> Vec<Action>
```

The driver (Integration phase, `stage-node-driver-and-server`) pushes
one `Input` at a time and is responsible for honouring the returned
`Action`s in order. The engine performs no I/O, holds no log entries
(only the index/term tail mirror), and uses no threads. This makes the
engine deterministic and trivially testable in a single-threaded
`cargo test` harness.

### Why pull-based (KRaft) rather than push-based (textbook Raft)

KRaft inverts the AppendEntries push: followers initiate `Fetch` RPCs
and the leader replies. The engine therefore exposes no heartbeat
timer; the follower's `Fetch` cadence (Stage 3.3) is what proves leader
liveness. Stage 3.1 still carries an `Action::AppendEntries` — but as a
*local* leader-side log-write side-effect (the no-op entry emitted on
election), not a wire RPC.

### Pre-Vote first, real vote second

`NodeRole` distinguishes `PreCandidate` from `Candidate` so the engine
can speculatively poll quorum reachability without bumping
`current_term` or persisting `voted_for`. This prevents partition-
induced term inflation (the textbook Raft disruption problem). The
role-transition methods (`become_pre_candidate`, `become_candidate`)
are wired in Stage 3.1; the on-receive handlers that interpret
PreVote/Vote responses and tally quorums are Stage 3.2.

**Pre-Vote safety — timer-driven re-election must not bump term.**
A `PreCandidate` whose election timer expires must NOT transition to
`Candidate`. Doing so would increment `current_term` without ever
receiving a quorum of pre-votes and reintroduces the very disruption
Pre-Vote exists to prevent (architecture.md §5.1). The Stage 3.1 tick
handler therefore restarts the Pre-Vote round (stays `PreCandidate`,
re-randomises the timer, re-emits `PreVoteRequest`s) on a PreCandidate
timeout. The `Follower → PreCandidate` transition still happens on a
Follower timeout. The `PreCandidate → Candidate` promotion is owned by
the Stage 3.2 `handle_pre_vote_response` quorum-tally path — never by
the tick handler.

### Logical-tick timer, not wall-clock

`ElectionTimer` counts ticks (`Input::Tick`) not milliseconds. The
driver fires `Tick` at `tick_interval_ms` (default 50 ms) and the
engine converts the configured `[election_timeout_min_ms,
election_timeout_max_ms]` range into a ticks range using ceiling
division (clamped to ≥ 1). This keeps the engine fully reproducible in
the deterministic test harness which advances a manual clock by tick
count.

### Action-based unsupported-input fence

Stage 3.1 only *handles* `Input::Tick` (plus construction). All other
declared `Input` variants whose handlers belong to later stages must be
visibly rejected via `Action::RejectUnsupportedInput` rather than
silently ignored. Stage 3.1 declares the full `Input` enum surface so
the driver can compile against it; later stages replace each rejection
with a real handler one at a time. This keeps the Stage 3.1 ↔ 3.2 ↔ 3.3
boundaries explicit and prevents the driver from believing it has been
served.

At Stage 3.1 landing time, eight inputs are rejected, grouped by the
stage that will later replace each rejection with a real handler:

- **Four Stage-3.2-deferred** (replaced when `stage-leader-election`
  lands): `Input::VoteRequest`, `Input::VoteResponse`,
  `Input::PreVoteRequest`, `Input::PreVoteResponse`.
- **Four Stage-3.3-deferred** (replaced when `stage-log-replication`
  lands): `Input::ClientPropose`, `Input::FetchRequest`,
  `Input::FetchResponse`, `Input::FetchRequestAcked`.

Each rejection carries a stable `input_kind` discriminant string and a
`reason` that names the deferring stage so operators and the driver
can route metrics/alerts.

## Phase → Stage → Step Decomposition

The work item is one phase. Each stage groups closely related steps
that build on each other but should land as separate PRs. File budgets
are honest: every step touches `xraft-core/src/node.rs` plus, at most,
a sibling module for re-exports or enum surface.

### Phase: Raft Node State Machine

#### Stage 1: Engine Data Structures

The foundation: the structs and enum surface every later stage depends
on. Each step here is a self-contained type with its own unit tests.

- Step 1.1 — `ElectionTimer`: logical-tick randomised timer with
  `from_config_ms`, `new`, `reset`, `tick`, `is_expired`, `remaining`,
  plus the `pick_in_range` helper. Ceiling-division for `min_ms` /
  `max_ms` → ticks; minimum 1 tick clamp; `max_ticks` clamped to at
  least `min_ticks`. Unit tests cover randomisation range, that
  `reset` re-rolls the target, and edge cases (`min == max`,
  sub-tick interval). Files: `xraft-core/src/node.rs`. Budget: 1.
- Step 1.2 — `PeerState`: per-peer replication tracker. Fields
  `last_fetch_offset: LogIndex`, `last_fetch_time: u64` (logical
  ticks; spec name from `architecture.md` §3.2),
  `last_caught_up_time: u64`, `is_voter: bool`. Provides
  `PeerState::new(is_voter)`. Tests cover field initialisation and
  the `Eq/Debug` derives needed by leader-election assertions. Files:
  `xraft-core/src/node.rs`. Budget: 1.
- Step 1.3 — `NodeRole::PreCandidate` and `VoteGrantedSet` in
  `xraft-core/src/types.rs`. Re-export through `xraft-core/src/lib.rs`.
  Backfill 1–2 derive tests on `VoteGrantedSet` (dedupes duplicate
  grants from the same voter — protects quorum-tally correctness in
  Stage 3.2). Files: `xraft-core/src/types.rs`,
  `xraft-core/src/lib.rs`. Budget: 2.
- Step 1.4 — `RaftNode` struct plus the two constructors and the
  read-only accessors:
  - `pub fn new(config: ClusterConfig) -> Result<Self>` — entropy-
    seeded RNG, production entry point.
  - `pub fn new_with_seed(config: ClusterConfig, seed: u64) -> Result<Self>`
    — deterministic RNG seed for tests and the simulation harness.
  - Both constructors validate `config` and build the `VoterSet`,
    returning `XRaftError::Config` on misconfiguration rather than
    silently degrading the engine.
  - Accessors: `current_term`, `voted_for`, `is_leader`,
    `set_last_log(index, term)`.
  - Initial state: `Follower`, term 0, no vote, election timer
    armed, `peers` populated from `voter_set` (excluding self) with
    `PeerState::new(true)`.
  - Tests: initial-state assertions and a `new_with_seed`
    determinism test (same seed → identical timer target). The
    `last_leader_contact_tick: Option<u64>` field is `None` on
    construction (a brand-new Follower has not yet observed a
    leader); `become_follower(_, Some(id))` sets it to
    `Some(self.logical_tick)` (see Resolved Decisions item 1).
  Files: `xraft-core/src/node.rs`, `xraft-core/src/lib.rs`
  (re-exports for `RaftNode`, `PeerState`, `ElectionTimer`). Budget: 2.

#### Stage 2: Role Transition Methods

Each `become_*` is one PR. All transitions share invariants (reset
timer, clear vote tally as appropriate, emit observability events) but
they have distinct preconditions and side-effects, so they get their
own review windows.

- Step 2.1 — `become_follower(term, leader_id: Option<NodeId>)`.
  Enforces the Raft §5.1 stale-term guard: a call with
  `term < current_term` is a debug-asserted no-op (no role change, no
  leader recorded, no actions emitted, `tracing::warn!`). If
  `term > current_term`, clears `voted_for` and emits
  `Action::PersistHardState`. Emits `Action::StepDown` if previously
  `Leader`. Records leader contact when `leader_id` is `Some`. Tests
  cover higher-term step-down, stale-term ignore, and that
  `voted_for` is preserved when term is unchanged. Files:
  `xraft-core/src/node.rs`. Budget: 1.
- Step 2.2 — `become_pre_candidate()`: MUST NOT mutate
  `current_term` or `voted_for`; sets `role = PreCandidate`,
  installs a fresh `pre_votes_received` (`VoteGrantedSet`) pre-credited
  with a self-pre-vote, resets the election timer with a fresh
  random target, and returns one
  `Action::SendMessage { to: <peer>, message:
  OutboundMessage::PreVoteRequest(..) }` per voter peer (the field
  name is `to`, matching `xraft-core/src/message.rs::Action`). Tests
  assert term and `voted_for` are unchanged, the self pre-vote is the
  sole entry, and one `SendMessage` per peer is emitted. The single-
  voter self-quorum cascade lives in Step 2.5. Files:
  `xraft-core/src/node.rs`. Budget: 1.
- Step 2.3 — `become_candidate()`: increments `current_term` by
  exactly one, sets `voted_for = Some(self.id)`, installs a fresh
  `votes_received` pre-credited with a self-vote, resets the
  election timer, emits `Action::PersistHardState` (term/vote bump
  must be durable before any RPC) followed by one
  `Action::SendMessage { to: <peer>, message:
  OutboundMessage::VoteRequest(..) }` per voter peer. Tests assert
  the term bump magnitude, self-vote presence, and `PersistHardState`
  ordering before any `SendMessage`. The single-voter self-quorum
  cascade lives in Step 2.5. Files: `xraft-core/src/node.rs`. Budget:
  1.
- Step 2.4 — `become_leader()`: initialises the `peers` map (one
  `PeerState` per voter except self, `last_fetch_offset = LogIndex(0)`,
  `last_fetch_time = self.logical_tick`,
  `last_caught_up_time = self.logical_tick`); emits
  `Action::BecomeLeader` followed by
  `Action::AppendEntries(vec![Entry { term: current_term, payload:
  EntryPayload::NoOp, .. }])`. Tests assert the no-op entry uses
  `current_term`, peers are fully initialised, and the action ordering
  is `BecomeLeader → AppendEntries`. Files: `xraft-core/src/node.rs`.
  Budget: 1.
- Step 2.5 — Single-voter self-quorum cascade. In a cluster whose
  `voter_set` has size 1 (this node only), the self pre-vote alone is
  already a pre-election quorum and the self vote alone is already an
  election quorum. There is no peer `PreVoteResponse` or `VoteResponse`
  to drive promotion through the Stage 3.2 handlers, so the engine
  MUST short-circuit inside `become_pre_candidate` and
  `become_candidate`:
  - At the end of `become_pre_candidate`, if `pre_votes_received` has
    already reached `voter_set.quorum_size()` (true iff `voter_set`
    has size 1), the method appends the actions returned by an
    immediate call to `become_candidate()` to its own return buffer
    instead of stopping at the fan-out.
  - At the end of `become_candidate`, if `votes_received` has already
    reached quorum, the method appends the actions returned by an
    immediate call to `become_leader()` to its own return buffer.
  This is the only place a Stage 3.1 transition emits the actions of a
  later transition; the cascade is contained, deterministic, and
  required for correctness because no asynchronous response would
  otherwise wake the node.

  **Test obligations.** The structured, grep-resolvable form lives in
  `wit-tree.yaml` under `step-single-voter-self-quorum-cascade ->
  test_obligations` (every scenario id and source-test function name
  is an atomic YAML scalar there). The two scenarios and what each
  asserts, separated into what the existing source test already
  covers and what this stage MUST additionally assert when the test
  is hardened. **Attribution: every entry under "Spec hardening
  assertions Stage 3.1 MUST add" is owned by the implementation PR
  that lands `step-single-voter-self-quorum-cascade`. These are
  obligations on the engineer's `xraft-core/src/node.rs` source
  edit, NOT on this planning document; the brief explicitly
  forbids modifying source files outside `docs/specs/`, so the
  planning iteration cannot satisfy them. The corresponding
  `implementation_pr_owner` field in `wit-tree.yaml` makes this
  attribution machine-checkable.**

  - Scenario `single-voter-cluster-auto-promotes-to-leader` — mirrors
    the existing source test
    `xraft-core/src/node.rs::single_voter_cluster_auto_promotes_to_leader`.
    Trigger: a direct call to `become_candidate()` on a one-voter
    cluster constructed via `RaftNode::new_with_seed`.
    - Existing source assertions: `node.role == NodeRole::Leader`;
      actions contains an `Action::PersistHardState`, an
      `Action::BecomeLeader`, and an `Action::AppendEntries(es)` with
      `es.len() == 1` and `es[0].payload == EntryPayload::NoOp`.
    - Spec hardening assertions Stage 3.1 MUST add: `node.current_term() == Term(1)`
      after the call (the term-bump magnitude is part of the cascade
      contract); actions contains zero `Action::SendMessage` entries
      (a one-voter cluster has no peers; any `SendMessage` indicates a
      regression in the peer-fan-out branch); and the first
      `Action::PersistHardState` appears before any subsequent
      `SendMessage` / `AppendEntries` / `BecomeLeader` (term/vote must
      be durable before any RPC-facing or log-mutating side-effect).
    - Purpose: exercises the Candidate→Leader half of the self-quorum
      cascade via a direct call (bypasses the Pre-Vote-side
      short-circuit, which the tick-driven scenario below covers).
  - Scenario `election-loop-in-single-voter-cluster-via-tick` —
    mirrors the existing source test
    `xraft-core/src/node.rs::election_loop_in_single_voter_cluster_via_tick`.
    Trigger: repeated `step(Input::Tick)` on a one-voter cluster
    until the election timer expires.
    - Existing source assertions: node reaches `NodeRole::Leader`
      within `election_timer.max_ticks() + 5` ticks;
      `node.current_term() == Term(1)` after promotion;
      `node.last_log_index == LogIndex(1)` after promotion (the no-op
      leader entry was appended).
    - Spec hardening assertions Stage 3.1 MUST add: none (the
      existing source assertions already fully cover the contract for
      this scenario).
    - Purpose: end-to-end dispatcher coverage of the full
      `handle_tick → become_pre_candidate → become_candidate →
      become_leader` Pre-Vote-first cascade. A direct unit test of
      `become_pre_candidate()` is unnecessary because the public
      `step` entrypoint already proves the pre-vote-side short-circuit
      fires; the direct `become_candidate()` scenario above covers
      the second half.

  Files: `xraft-core/src/node.rs`. Budget: 1.

#### Stage 3: Input Dispatcher and Tick Handler

The public surface (`step`) and the only input owned by 3.1
(`Tick`). The unsupported-input fence lives here too because it is
the contract boundary with 3.2/3.3.

- Step 3.1 — Extend `Input` / `Action` enums in
  `xraft-core/src/message.rs` to the full Stage 3.1 surface:
  - `Input::Tick`, plus the four Stage-3.2-deferred variants
    (`VoteRequest`, `VoteResponse`, `PreVoteRequest`,
    `PreVoteResponse`) and the four Stage-3.3-deferred variants
    (`ClientPropose`, `FetchRequest`, `FetchResponse`,
    `FetchRequestAcked`). All eight are declared in 3.1 so the
    driver can compile against the full surface; their handlers are
    placeholder `RejectUnsupportedInput` arms (see Step 3.3).
  - `Action` surface adds `PersistHardState`, `AppendEntries`,
    `SendMessage { to: NodeId, message: OutboundMessage }` (the field
    is named `to`, NOT `target` — must match the existing
    `xraft-core/src/message.rs::Action::SendMessage` declaration),
    `BecomeLeader`, `StepDown`, `RejectUnsupportedInput {
    input_kind: &'static str, reason: String }`. Stage-3.3-only
    actions (`ApplyToStateMachine`, `TakeSnapshot`,
    `InstallSnapshot`, `ServeFetch`, `TruncateLog`) are declared
    here but unused until 3.3.
  - Re-export `Input`, `Action`, `OutboundMessage` through
    `lib.rs`. Files: `xraft-core/src/message.rs`,
    `xraft-core/src/lib.rs`. Budget: 2.
- Step 3.2 — `step(input)` skeleton and `Input::Tick` handling.
  Match on `Input`, dispatch to per-variant private helpers,
  accumulate `Vec<Action>` via a local buffer. The match
  deliberately enumerates every variant (no wildcard arm) so Rust's
  exhaustiveness checker forces any future `Input` addition to
  pick between a real handler and another rejection. Tick handling:
  increment `self.logical_tick`, `self.election_timer.tick()`; on
  expiry, branch by `self.role`:
  - `Follower` → call `become_pre_candidate()`.
  - **`PreCandidate` → call `become_pre_candidate()` again** —
    restart the Pre-Vote round (re-roll timer, re-emit
    `PreVoteRequest`s). **No term bump on a timer-driven re-roll**;
    that promotion is owned by `handle_pre_vote_response` in
    Stage 3.2 once it observes a quorum of pre-vote grants.
  - `Candidate` → fall back to `become_pre_candidate()`. A
    Candidate that has timed out has the same partition-disruption
    risk as a Follower; routing through `PreCandidate` honours the
    "no term bump without liveness evidence" invariant.
  - `Leader` and `Observer` → no-op (KRaft has no leader heartbeat;
    Check-Quorum lands in the future
    `stage-cluster-bootstrap-and-membership`).
  Adds a `#[tracing::instrument]` span per `step` invocation and a
  `tracing::info!` per role transition. Tests cover the
  Follower→PreCandidate transition, the PreCandidate-timeout
  pre-vote-restart (term unchanged), the Candidate-timeout fallback
  to PreCandidate, and the Leader / Observer no-op. Files:
  `xraft-core/src/node.rs`. Budget: 1.
- Step 3.3 — `RejectUnsupportedInput` fence for the **eight**
  inputs whose handlers belong to a later stage:
  - **Four Stage-3.2-deferred**: `VoteRequest`, `VoteResponse`,
    `PreVoteRequest`, `PreVoteResponse` — `reason` names "Stage 3.2
    (Leader Election)".
  - **Four Stage-3.3-deferred**: `ClientPropose`, `FetchRequest`,
    `FetchResponse`, `FetchRequestAcked` — `reason` names "Stage 3.3
    (Log Replication)".
  Each rejection emits exactly one `Action::RejectUnsupportedInput`
  with a stable `input_kind: &'static str` discriminant and the
  `reason` string. The arm bodies do not touch `self`, encoding the
  no-mutation invariant. Tests assert one-and-only-one rejection per
  input and that role/term/vote/commit/last-applied/log-tip/election
  timer all stay unchanged. Files: `xraft-core/src/node.rs`.
  Budget: 1.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Tracing.** Every role transition and every `step` invocation
  emits a `tracing` event under `xraft_core::node`. Tests do not
  assert on log output, but the spans give the driver in the
  Integration phase observable seams.
- **Determinism.** All randomisation flows through a single
  `StdRng` owned by `RaftNode`. The election timer's own RNG is
  re-seeded from the node RNG at construction so the entire engine
  is deterministic when constructed via `new_with_seed`.
- **Storage trait surface is unchanged.** Stage 3.1 does not modify
  `LogStore` / `HardStateStore` / `SnapshotStore` traits. The engine
  works against the in-memory log/term mirror only; durability is
  enforced by `Action::PersistHardState` which the driver honours
  before any RPC reply.

## Out of Scope (for this work item)

- **Stage 3.2 — Leader Election handlers.**
  `handle_vote_request`, `handle_vote_response`,
  `handle_pre_vote_request`, `handle_pre_vote_response`, the
  quorum-tally logic, the `PreCandidate → Candidate` promotion on
  pre-vote quorum, and the higher-term step-down on observed
  response terms all belong to 3.2 (`stage-leader-election`).
  Stage 3.1 only declares those `Input` variants and rejects them.
- **Stage 3.3 — Log Replication.** Leader-side Fetch service,
  follower-side Fetch scheduling, high-watermark advancement,
  `ApplyToStateMachine` emission, `DivergingEpoch` truncation, and
  `FetchRequestAcked` per-peer-progress update are all 3.3
  (`stage-log-replication`).
- **gRPC transport / driver loop.** Networking phase
  (`stage-grpc-transport`) and Integration phase
  (`stage-node-driver-and-server`) own the network and the
  `tokio::select!` event loop.
- **Snapshot install / take.** Persistent Storage phase
  (`stage-snapshot-storage`) and a future
  `stage-snapshot-install-protocol`.
- **Membership changes / Check-Quorum.** Integration phase
  (`stage-cluster-bootstrap-and-membership`).
- **Admin HTTP and metrics.** Integration phase
  (`stage-admin-api-and-observability`).

## Cross-Document Supersedes

`docs/stories/failover-cluster-XRAFT/implementation-plan.md` Stage 3.1
predates the explicit Pre-Vote safety decision recorded in this plan
(architecture.md §5.1). Its old acceptance criteria are updated in the
same iteration that lands this design — specifically:

- Old impl-step #5 ("trigger candidacy if [election timer] expired")
  is rewritten so the Follower-timeout path enters `PreCandidate`,
  not `Candidate`, and term is not bumped without pre-vote quorum.
- Old test scenario `election-timeout-triggers-candidacy` ("transitions
  to Candidate and increments term") is rewritten as
  `election-timeout-triggers-pre-candidacy` ("transitions to
  PreCandidate WITHOUT incrementing term"). The full term-bump
  promotion is owned by Stage 3.2's existing `election-wins-majority`
  scenario and Stage 3.2's pre-vote-quorum-tally handler (the new
  `pre_vote_response` quorum-check path Stage 3.2 introduces); a
  dedicated `pre-vote-quorum-promotes-to-candidate` scenario name
  belongs to Stage 3.2 and is NOT introduced here. The single-voter
  cascade scenarios introduced in Step 2.5 above
  (`single-voter-cluster-auto-promotes-to-leader` and
  `election-loop-in-single-voter-cluster-via-tick`) cover the special
  one-voter path that has no asynchronous response event; both names
  match existing source-test function names in
  `xraft-core/src/node.rs` so the obligation grep-resolves to the
  actual test entrypoints.

The cross-doc edit is included in this iteration's commit so the two
documents agree.

In the same pass, the dependency slugs in
`docs/stories/failover-cluster-XRAFT/implementation-plan.md` for Stage
3.3 (Log Replication), Phase 4 (Network Transport), and Phase 5 (State
Machine Interface) are normalised to `phase-consensus-engine` (was
`phase-raft-consensus-engine`) so every downstream stage that depends
on Stage 3.1 cites the same parent-phase anchor declared in this
plan's frontmatter (`parent_phase_anchor: phase-consensus-engine`) and
in `workstreams.yaml`. The `phase-raft-...` prefix survives only as
branch-name history, documented in the `workstreams.yaml` note.

## Resolved Decisions

These were open questions in earlier iterations and are now resolved:

1. **`last_leader_contact_tick` updates.** The field is
   `last_leader_contact_tick: Option<u64>` (typed consistently with
   `docs/stories/failover-cluster-XRAFT/implementation-plan.md`
   line 156). Initial value is `None` — a brand-new Follower has
   not yet observed any leader in the current era. Stage 3.1 only
   writes the field from the explicit `become_follower(_, Some(id))`
   path, setting it to `Some(self.logical_tick)`. Stage 3.3 will
   also bump it on every successful `FetchResponse`. The field is
   `pub(crate)` so 3.3 can update without re-architecting.
2. **`PreCandidate` counts its own pre-vote.** Following the
   `etcd-raft` convention, the self pre-vote is pre-credited in
   `become_pre_candidate`. Combined with the **single-voter self-
   quorum cascade in Step 2.5**, this allows a single-node cluster
   to self-promote from `Follower → PreCandidate → Candidate →
   Leader` without any peer response event ever arriving. The two
   named test obligations are kept atomic and grep-resolvable to the
   existing source-test function names in `xraft-core/src/node.rs`:
   `single-voter-cluster-auto-promotes-to-leader` mirrors
   `single_voter_cluster_auto_promotes_to_leader`, and
   `election-loop-in-single-voter-cluster-via-tick` mirrors
   `election_loop_in_single_voter_cluster_via_tick`. The split
   between what the existing source tests already assert and what
   Stage 3.1 MUST additionally assert when the tests are hardened
   lives in Step 2.5 above and in `wit-tree.yaml` under
   `step-single-voter-self-quorum-cascade → test_obligations`.
3. **`Action` ordering.** The driver must process `Action`s in the
   order emitted. The Stage 3.1 invariant is "`PersistHardState`
   before any `SendMessage` that depends on the persisted field" —
   encoded by always pushing `PersistHardState` first in the
   affected transitions.

## Open Questions

1. **Leftover backup artefacts (`xraft-core/src/node.rs.review-backup`).**
   Per operator guidance (`stage-3-1-leftover-backup-files-cleanup`
   answered `delete-via-future-workstream`), cleanup of the remaining
   `node.rs.review-backup` is deferred to a dedicated future
   workstream; the four `.iter-snapshot.bak` files are gitignored. No
   source-tree changes belong in this planning iteration — the brief
   forbids modifying source files outside `docs/specs/`.
